                It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat (chicken, lamb, prawn, or fish), and sometimes, in addition, 
                eggs and/or vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties.

                The rice is usually one of the long-grained varieties like basmati. It is often cooked with spices like cardamom,
                 cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaves. The meat is usually marinated in yogurt and spices before being cooked. 
                 The dish is then cooked in a sealed pot, which allows the flavors to meld together.
